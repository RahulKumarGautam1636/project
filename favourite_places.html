      <li><a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"><h3><em>JAPAN-place of unbeatable nature and traditional values..</em></h3></a></li>
      <p><em>The main reason behind my desire to visit JAPAN is my love for japanese culture, nature and their traditions. Japan is a technologically advanced but they have also retained their traditional side. You can still see the traditional lamps with messages on them.
       the Japanese learned science by way of China or from Europe in the Meiji Era. However, in recent decades Japan has been a leading innovator in several fields, including chemical engineering, nanotechnology, and robotics. There are many technological companies in Japan, and these companies make products for export.
      When it comes to popular culture, Japan is famous for making video games. Many of the biggest companies that make games, like Nintendo, Namco, and Sega, are Japanese. Other well-known parts of Japanese arts are comics, called manga, and digital animation, or anime. Many people get to know Japanese or how life in Japan is like by reading manga or watching anime on television.
      I hope someday in my life i will be able to manage myself somehow so i can visit Japan for noce and all.

      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiyogi_Shiva_statue"><h3><em>ADIYOGI TEMPLE-The guru among the gurus..</em></h3></a></li>
      <p>In Yoga, Lord Shiva is considered the Ādi Yogi and the Adi Guru. He is the foremost among the yogis and the first teacher of the science of Yoga. He is an ideal ascetic and an ideal householder, all in one.He is depicted as sitting in lotus pose on mount Kailāså, unmoved by the events of the universe. He body is smeared with sacred ash. In his hair is the crescent moon symbolizing mystical vision and knowledge. The serpent coiled around his neck symbolizes the mysterious kundalini energy present in all of us. The river Ganges cascades from the crown of his head symbolizing perpetual purification, which he bestows upon his devotees. He is the three-eyed one or Trilochana as he has the third eye or the eye of wisdom in the centre of the forehead.

      <p>Noone can deny including me that the reason for everyone to visit Kashmir is the beauty of kashmir.
        Enchanting Beauty of Kashmir never fails to attract tourist from all over the world. It is the most beautiful place in India to visit. Everyone desires to visit Kashmir due to its unspoiled natural beauty. The Kashmir is mostly famous among the children n whichever age group you belong to, Kashmir has everything that you are looking for.
        It is the only place which offers too many activities to do like trekking, ice skating, River Crossing, Paragliding etc. There is not shortage for such fun filled activities here the state of Jammu and Kashmir is the region which widely varies with the people and climate.There is not any parameter that can map the beauty of Kashmir.
